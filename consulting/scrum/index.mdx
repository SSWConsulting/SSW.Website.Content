    descriptions:
        - Scrum is an Agile Software Development methodology. Focusing on communication, Scrum is utilized to achieve effective delivery of complex software projects. It enables high-quality software by scheduling regular incremental releases. Customers are closely involved in the process and are encouraged to review and change priorities, based on their changing business needs and users' feedback.
        - The Scrum methodology includes three key parts:
        - <i class="fa fa-check"></i> <strong> Time-boxed meetings with the client at the start and finish of a sprint</strong>
        - <i class="fa fa-check"></i> <strong> A 15-minute Daily Scrum meeting</strong>
        - <i class="fa fa-check"></i> <strong> "Acceptance Criteria" and "Definition of Done", for developers to affirm that a feature is completed</strong>
        - In Scrum, the client, who is also known as the Product Owner, re-prioritizes tasks at the beginning of each sprint so that the Scrum team is always working on the most important features of the product. Meanwhile, the Scrum will be facilitated by a Scrum Master who is accountable for removing any impediments that the team may face.
        - Lastly, the Development Team should be a self-organized team that consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of "Done" product at the end of each Sprint. Only members of the Development Team create the Increment.

          title: PROMOTING TRANSPARENCY
          description: The periodic Scrum meeting promotes transparency for both development progress and process. It provides clear a view for all team members of what activities are on-going and how well the whole project is performing.

          title: REGULAR INSPECTION OF THE PROCESS TO LIMIT VARIANCES
          description: Working with the Scrum methodology, it is much easier for managers to get clear inspections of the project periodically. Therefore, any time the project is not going according to plan, the managers will be able to react quickly.

          title: ADAPTATION TO CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES OR REQUIREMENTS
          description: In a real project development situation, things may not always go according to plan. The Scrum methodology is a perfect solution for adapting to change. It allows all the team members to be aware of any changes as soon as possible. It also provides an ideal communication environment between the Product Owner and the developers.

          title: HAPPIER CLIENTS
          description: Instead of keeping the client waiting until the final design is deployed, Scrum allows the client to have a clear image of how well the project is going. This will improve the satisfaction level of the client both during the project and afterwards.
