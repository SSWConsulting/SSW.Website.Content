    descriptions:
        - China is a booming market and now is the time to take advantage of this growing user base. If you have a successful application that you would like to bring to the Chinese market, then working with SSW can help streamline your entry into this market.
        - Bringing an application is more than just getting the UI translated. There are other things to consider such as Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) being blocked by the Chinese government, common services such as YouTube being blocked, and all common "western social media" sites being blocked.
        - SSW can assist you in bringing web applications, desktop applications, and mobile applications to the local Chinese market.
