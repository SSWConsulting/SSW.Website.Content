# Augmented Reality in the Modern Workplace

Microsoft HoloLens, which is also known as "Project Baraboo", is a pair of mixed reality smart glasses developed by Microsoft. It is the first fully self-contained, holographic computer, enabling users to interact with high-definition holograms in real world.
