        - Every business needs to keep on top of its finances. Many popular accounting software products have now moved from locally hosted to cloud-based systems, which helps businesses stay organized while carrying out standard accounting activities anywhere-anytime.
        - Xero and MYOB are entirely cloud-based accounting software for small and large businesses. They perform bookkeeping functions like invoicing and payroll and among other things allow users to connect to live bank feeds and other third-party services. One of the great benefits of accounting software like MOYB and Xero is that they provide a reporting dashboard which has an overview of your business and financial status. They also help businesses do online-billing, track payments and avoid bookkeeping errors.
