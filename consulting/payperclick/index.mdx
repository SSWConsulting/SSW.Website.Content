# Acquire more clients using PPC campaigns

Pay Per Click (Search Engine Marketing) advertising has come a long way in the last few years. Businesses are now able to target their prospects based on their interests and actions on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Twitter. LinkedIn allows you to quickly put your message in front of professionals and even target them using their job roles or industry, for example. Twitter will let you target lookalike profiles of people who follow a digital influencer, specific keywords, or conversation topics that they are interested in.
